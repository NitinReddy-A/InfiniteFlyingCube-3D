## Introduction
This project demonstrates basic 3D graphics concepts using Pygame and OpenGL. Users can interact with a 3D space filled with moving cubes, customize the appearance and behavior of the cubes, and navigate through the environment.

## Features
  - Color Selection: Choose from a variety of colors for the cubes.
  - Speed Adjustment: Adjust the speed at which cubes move.
  - Size Customization: Define the size of the cubes.
  - Interactive Navigation: Use keyboard controls to navigate through the 3D space.
## Requirements
  - Python 3.x
  - Pygame
  - PyOpenGL
## Installation
Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InfiniteFlyingCube-3D.git
    cd InfiniteFlyingCube-3D
Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Run the script:

    python main.py
Follow the prompts to customize your 3D cube environment.

## Controls
  - Arrow Keys: Move the camera in the 3D space.
  - Q: Quit the simulation.
## Customization
Upon running the script, you'll be prompted to:

  - Select Color: Choose from red, green, yellow, blue, cyan, magenta, white, black.
  - Select Speed: Choose from 1x, 1.5x, 2x.
  - Select Cube Size: Enter a numerical value for the size of the cubes.
